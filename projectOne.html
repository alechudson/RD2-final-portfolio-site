            <h2>Pool Pucks</h2>
            <p>This project was brought to life to make it easier for swimmers to return to the same location after swimming for some time. This recently became more important as the team is required to keep swimmer spread apart due to COVID-19.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>3D printed pucks sound cool in theory, however, the problem is that normally printed parts tend to float rather than sink. In the first prototype of the puck, the idea was that it would be a two-part enclosure held shut with zip ties.

In the first prototype of the puck, the idea was that it would be a two-part enclosure held shut with zip ties. The inner hollow part would then be filled with rocks or something else heavy to provide the necessary weight. This version was never even printed just due to the complexity and materials cost that would be associated with it. On to the next prototype.</p>
            <p>In the second prototype, the idea was to print a flexible form that I could pour the concrete into and later remove, thus resulting in solid concrete weight. The big glaring issue here was that these weights would potentially need to be removed daily from the pool. With all of the movement back and forth, the likelihood of broken concrete would be high. This idea was later reinforced by another coach during one of our weekly meetings.</p>

            <h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
            <p>For the current solution, the idea was to combine the advantages of 3D printing with the weight that can be provided by concrete. This was achieved by printing the rubber bumper/icon with a slightly negative internal draft angle (pictured above) to ensure the concrete couldn't slip out. The bonus of this is that now the pucks are also much more durable and resistant to dropping. Additionally, the icon at the center of the puck is much more visible. The final result is shown in the center of the picture below.</p>

            <p>The earth icon in the center looks a bit rough but this was solved in the proceeding versions by sifting the concrete a bit more.</p>
